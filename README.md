# Best practices for maintaining the Silberg lab github repositories

## What to put on this?
- Any code that you used to do analysis, make figures for a publication etc. should be accessible to other lab members!

## What should your repository have?
- A minimal README that details what your code does, and how to use it?

## How to manage the steps?
Ideally, have your own original repository (for safety) and fork it to `SilbergLabRice` organization so others can access and improve on it
